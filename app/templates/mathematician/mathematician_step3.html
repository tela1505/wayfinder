                <p>To stand out from the crowd, it is important to identify which skills will help you excel and succeed in a career as a mathematician. The skills we believe are highly desirable for this role are:</p>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fundamentals of mathematics</li>
                    <li>Applications of mathematics (how to use mathematical skills in the real world)</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>Additional knowledge in the following areas may help too:</p>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Useful knowledge on any topic you find interesting! (Mathematics can be applied to a wide variety of use cases, from business to medicine) Learn more about what excites you and how you can apply mathematics to make it even better!</li>
                    <li>Coding fundamentals (much easier than you think!)</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>For each of these skills and domain areas, we have compiled a list of relevant resources that we believe will help you out a lot! They are fun, short and sweet videos that do a great job of explaining all the basic concepts required.</p>
